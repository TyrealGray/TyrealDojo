This project was bootstrapped with [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
## To begin
Just use `npm i` to install and `npm run dev` (or `npm run build && node start.js`) to run

## Some notes
- Front-end and Server are separated, you need to open them one by one, sorry for the inconvenience, web page will try looking for port `2019`
- I did not use `fixer.io` for currency exchange api, I found [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) on github.
- I did not implement unit test and swagger :P
- three endpoints `/api/login`, `/api/check` & `/api/convert`
