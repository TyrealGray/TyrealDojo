##How to start
you could directly open `index.html` 
####or 
run `npm i`, then use `npm run dev` to start webpack dev server to see the demo

##Notice
Since I could not use API directly in demo( CORS feature is not turned on in server ).

The data is all mock in mock folder, and the url I used is in comment.

If this project could host on the right domain, it should work.
